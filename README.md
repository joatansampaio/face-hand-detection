This project is a Java application that utilizes OpenCV to perform real-time face and hand detection. It leverages pre-trained data models for accurate and efficient detection. 

## Features

- Face detection with a pre-trained model.
- Hand detection with a pre-trained model.
- Real-time video processing for detection.
- Customizable detection parameters.

## Demo

Include a GIF or video that demonstrates your program in action.
